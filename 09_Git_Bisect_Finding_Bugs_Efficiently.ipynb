    "# Git Bisect: Finding Bugs Efficiently 🕵️‍♂️🐛\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Git bisect is a powerful tool that helps developers quickly find the commit that introduced a bug in their application. Instead of checking out each commit manually, `git bisect` allows us to use a binary search algorithm to pinpoint the faulty commit efficiently.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Start the Bisect Process**\n",
    "   - `git bisect start` initializes the bisect operation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Mark a Bad Commit** ❌\n",
    "   - `git bisect bad` tells Git the current commit has the bug.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Mark a Good Commit** ✅\n",
    "   - `git bisect good <commit_hash>` tells Git where the bug was not present.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Binary Search** 🔍\n",
    "   - Git will checkout a middle commit.\n",
    "   - You test if the bug is present.\n",
    "   - If the bug exists, mark it as `git bisect bad`.\n",
    "   - If the bug does not exist, mark it as `git bisect good`.\n",
    "   - Repeat until Git finds the first bad commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Identifying the Buggy Commit** 🛠️\n",
    "   - Git pinpoints the exact commit where the issue was introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reset to Normal State**\n",
    "   - `git bisect reset` brings the repository back to normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `git bisect`, we efficiently pinpointed the commit where the bug originated, saving time and effort compared to manually checking each commit. This technique is invaluable when debugging large projects.\n",
