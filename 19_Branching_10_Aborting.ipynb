    "# üìå Handling Merge Conflicts and Aborting a Merge in Git\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßê What Happens When You Encounter Merge Conflicts?\n",
    "When merging branches in Git, you might face **merge conflicts**. This happens when Git is unable to automatically reconcile differences between the branches. In such cases, Git requires you to manually resolve the conflicts before proceeding with the merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ü§î What If You're Not Ready to Resolve the Conflicts?\n",
    "Sometimes, you may not have time to resolve conflicts immediately, or you may be in the middle of another task. In such situations, Git provides a way to **abort the merge** and return to the previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ How to Abort a Merge\n",
    "To **abort an ongoing merge**, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git merge --abort\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù Explanation:\n",
    "- This command cancels the merge process.\n",
    "- It resets your working directory to the state before the merge started.\n",
    "- If you have already resolved some conflicts and staged the changes, those changes will be discarded.\n",
    "- Your repository will return to a clean state as if the merge never happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ† Example Scenario\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a New Repository and Initialize Git\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir merge-example\n",
    "$ cd merge-example\n",
    "$ git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/merge-example/.git/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create and Switch to a New Branch\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git checkout -b feature-branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Switched to a new branch 'feature-branch'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create a File and Make Changes in Different Branches\n",
    "#### On `feature-branch`\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"Hello from feature branch!\" > file.txt\n",
    "git add file.txt\n",
    "git commit -m \"Added file.txt in feature branch\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[feature-branch (root-commit) 123abc] Added file.txt in feature branch\n",
    " 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n",
    " create mode 100644 file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Switch to `main` and Modify the Same File\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git checkout main\n",
    "echo \"Hello from main branch!\" > file.txt\n",
    "git add file.txt\n",
    "git commit -m \"Modified file.txt in main branch\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[main 456def] Modified file.txt in main branch\n",
    " 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Try to Merge `feature-branch` into `main`\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git merge feature-branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output (Merge Conflict Detected):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Auto-merging file.txt\n",
    "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt\n",
    "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Abort the Merge\n",
    "If you're not ready to resolve the conflict, use:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git merge --abort\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:** (No explicit output, but the merge is aborted)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Verify the Merge Abort\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "nothing to commit, working tree clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Summary\n",
    "- **Encountered a merge conflict?** Git will notify you about it.\n",
    "- **Not ready to resolve?** Use `git merge --abort` to go back to the previous clean state.\n",
    "- **No changes will be saved** from the merge attempt if you abort it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is very useful when dealing with complex conflicts and needing to step back before making final decisions. üõ†Ô∏èüî•\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy coding! üöÄ"
