    "# Git Branch Management - Fixing a Bug üêû\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction üìå\n",
    "Git is a powerful tool for version control, and managing branches effectively is a crucial skill. In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating, switching, renaming, modifying, and deleting branches while fixing a bug. We will also examine the necessary Git commands and their outputs to ensure a smooth workflow.\n",

    "## Creating a New Branch üå±\n",
    "When we receive a bug report, the best practice is to create a new branch to isolate the fix. We do this using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git branch bugfix\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Available Branches üßê\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git branch\n",
