    "# 📌 Comparing Branches in Git\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧐 Introduction\n",
    "When working with Git, it's crucial to compare branches before merging them into the main branch (e.g., `master`). In this guide, we’ll explore various ways to check how a branch differs from `master` using Git commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Checking Commits in a Branch\n",
    "Before merging a branch, we need to identify the commits that exist in the feature or bugfix branch but not in `master`. We use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git log master..bugfix/signup-form\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Output:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "commit fc89881a9248f431c31e97ed56e8091db8b99e3f (bugfix/signup-form)\n",
    "Author: Sithum Bimsara <sithim.22@cse.mrt.ac.lk>\n",
    "Date:   Sun Mar 23 02:06:47 2025 +0530\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changed audience.txt from bugfix/signup-form branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 Explanation:\n",
    "- This command lists all the commits in `bugfix/signup-form` that are **not** in `master`.\n",
    "- In this case, there is **one commit**, but if there were more, all of them would be listed.\n",
    "- The `master..bugfix/signup-form` syntax means: \"Show me all commits in `bugfix/signup-form` that `master` doesn’t have.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 If you want a more concise output, you can use:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git log --oneline master..bugfix/signup-form\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠 Viewing Code Changes\n",
    "If we want to see the actual file changes instead of just commit messages, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git diff master..bugfix/signup-form\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Output:\n",
    "```diff\n",
    "diff --git a/audience.txt b/audience.txt\n",
    "index a9fd72c..1e80bad 100644\n",
    "--- a/audience.txt\n",
    "+++ b/audience.txt\n",
    "@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@\n",
    " Who are you?\n",
    "+==========================\n",
    "+My name is Sithum Wickramanayake\n",
    "\n",
    "-My name is Sithum Bimsara\n",
    "-I'm 22 years old\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 Explanation:\n",
    "- The `+` lines indicate new additions.\n",
    "- The `-` lines indicate removals.\n",
    "- This tells us that the `audience.txt` file has been modified: \n",
    "  - The old name \"Sithum Bimsara\" was changed to \"Sithum Wickramanayake\".\n",
    "  - \"I'm 22 years old\" was removed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "👉 If we are currently on `master`, we can simplify the command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git diff bugfix/signup-form\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📂 Checking Affected Files\n",
    "Sometimes, we don’t need to see the detailed changes, just the **list of modified files**. We use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git diff --name-status bugfix/signup-form\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Output:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "M       audience.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 Explanation:\n",
    "- The `M` means the file **audience.txt** has been modified.\n",
    "- This helps quickly identify which files will be changed when merging the branch.\n",
